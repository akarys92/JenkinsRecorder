# JenkinsRecorder
This is a system for tracking your teams Jenkins operations in a sensible manner. The system is designed to be run as a scheduled task 
either locally or in a cloud app. It makes various calls into your Jenkins system and records their results tracking all the data it collects
into Azure Tables. From there the data can be visualized in PowerBi giving you a powerful glimpse into the performance of your 
orchestration pipeline.
